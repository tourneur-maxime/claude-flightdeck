**A Claude Code mod that puts a live agent dashboard in your terminal**: context and rate limits, an advisor timeline, every permission check, and your subagents as cards or swimlanes. Every number comes from a real session event, and nothing leaves your machine.

## Install

Inside Claude Code (2.1.287 or later):

```
/plugin marketplace add scasella/claude-flightdeck
/plugin install flightdeck@claude-flightdeck
/reload-plugins
/flightdeck
```

<details>
<summary><strong>From the terminal, or from a clone</strong></summary>

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add scasella/claude-flightdeck
claude plugin install flightdeck@claude-flightdeck
```

Or load it straight from a clone, for one session:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scasella/claude-flightdeck
claude --plugin-dir ./claude-flightdeck
```

</details>

The installer may say config options aren't set; the defaults are fine, and [`/config`](#configure) changes them.

Mods are an early-access Claude Code feature and their API can change between releases. If something breaks, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

| Docked beside the transcript | Inline above the prompt |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="docs/media/docked-pane.png" alt="The docked pane: main model vitals, architect timeline, permission gate, five agents as swimlanes, last-turn receipt and session log" width="380"> | <img src="docs/media/inline-mini.png" alt="The inline mini layout: the model, context gauge, session cost and architect consults; the permission gate strip and totals; the last turn's duration, agents, edits, errors and cost" width="420"><br><br>On the main screen, without fullscreen, the pane is a summary of at most 8 rows; up to 3 agents join it when the session has subagents. |

| Panel | Shows | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **main** | model, effort, permission mode, request count; a context gauge with compactions (⟲); the first two rate-limit windows when your plan reports them, and the session's cost under `cost: on` | `turn.step`, `session.measure`, `session.compact`, `$.session.usage()` |
| **architect** | consults on a timeline, whether one is running, how long the last took; optionally the moment of each consult; the first line of a subagent architect's advice | a spawn of a matching agent type, or a matching server tool in the assistant's rows |
| **gate** | one cell per permission check: green allowed without asking, blue decided by the auto-mode classifier or you and then run, amber pending, red ✗ denied, dim if made inside a subagent. Totals, and a drill-down per tool family with credentials masked | `tool.check`, settled by the `tool.call` around it |
| **agents** | cards side by side while they fit: the task, type, live context and output tokens, steps, a running clock, `max_tokens` in red. Beyond that, swimlanes on one time axis, hung off one trunk that starts under the header: a branch (`├─`, the last `└─`) per agent. Sub-agents sit under the agent that spawned them, at any depth: one level further along the trunk in the lanes, `↳ parent` on a card, the parent in the expanded card | `agent.spawn` (with its `parentAgentId`), `turn.step`, `tool.call`, `turn.complete` |
| **loops** | model loops that match no card: workflow agents, compactions, memory forks | `turn.step` ids no card claims |
| **receipt** | the running turn, or the last one: duration, agents, edits, errors, and the cost added under `cost: on` | `turn.start`, `turn.complete` |
| **log** | prompts, spawns, completions, consults, edits, errors and denials; filtered to one agent while you view its transcript | all of the above |

Connectors animate only while work flows: a turn is running, an agent is running, or a consult is open. On the agents' rails and the lanes' trunk each branch flows while its own agent runs and goes dim when it ends. Panels with nothing to show take no room, so a session without subagents shows just the main box and the log.

At the foot of the docked pane stands Clawd, Claude Code's own mascot, in his own colours: he waves while an agent runs, blinks now and then while the main loop works, and stands still otherwise. He is not drawn in the inline summary, nor in a pane narrower than 40 columns; `mascot: off` leaves him out.

## Use

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/flightdeck` | open the pane |
| `/flightdeck close` | close it |
| `/flightdeck reset` | clear agents, checks, consults, log and the turn (cost, rate limits and compactions stay) |
| `/flightdeck layout auto\|compact\|wide\|mini` | override the layout for this session |

Focus the pane with `ctrl+x tab`, then:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `1`, `2`, … | expand an agent card or lane: its full task, last 3 tool calls, start of its answer |
| `f` `s` `o` | open the gate's file / shell / other drill-down: the last 5 checks and their verdicts |

`/clear` resets the pane along with the conversation.

## Where it runs

- **Fullscreen terminal:** docked beside the transcript; two columns from 110 columns wide.
- **Main-screen terminal:** inline above the prompt, as the 8-row summary.
- **Desktop app, VS Code, mobile:** the same panels, plus the agents drawn as an SVG time axis. VS Code and mobile can't animate, so connectors, the lanes' trunk, clocks and Clawd are static there.

With `openOnStart`, the pane opens by itself when a session starts, in terminals at least 144 columns wide; below that, `/flightdeck` opens it. Colours come from your Claude Code theme, so light, dark and colour-blind themes all read.

## What it can reach

Flightdeck only watches. Every hook passes its event on unchanged: it never denies, rewrites or delays a tool call, a prompt or a subagent.

| It sees | Through |
| --- | --- |
| every tool call's name and input, and whether it failed | `tool.call` |
| every permission verdict | `tool.check` |
| subagent spawns, their model requests and token usage, and their final answers | `agent.spawn`, `turn.step`, `turn.complete` |
| your prompts' first 70 characters, for the log | `turn.start` |
| context, cost and rate-limit readings | `session.measure`, `$.session.usage()` |
| advisor tool calls in the assistant's responses (their content is encrypted) | `session.append` |

What it keeps: short summaries (a tool name plus a path or command, with credentials masked) in session state, which ends with the session. It makes **no** network requests, runs no processes, reads and writes no files, stores nothing across sessions, and calls no model. `claude plugin validate .` prints exactly what it hooks and calls.

## What is inferred, not measured

- **Architect moments.** "Before a plan" means no edits yet this turn, "error repeats" means 2+ main-loop errors in a row, "before done" means edits were made. They are labelled `(inferred)`; turn them off with `moments: false`.
- **Server-side advice is encrypted.** For a server tool such as Claude Code's `advisor`, the pane counts and times the consult but cannot show what it said.
- **Per-agent context is the latest request's whole input** (uncached + cache read + cache write). It is labelled `ctx`, not cost: the API has no per-agent cost.
- **Other loops** can't tell a workflow agent from a compaction fork; both are model loops no card claims.
- **A background agent's first step** can arrive before its card exists, so its usage may show one step late.
- **Top-level placement in the agent tree.** Who spawned whom is measured (`parentAgentId`). But an agent whose parent has no card among those drawn (an architect, or an agent dropped from the list or not shown) is drawn at the top level, beside the main loop's own agents. Its expanded card still names the real parent: the architect, or `agent` when no card is left. In the lanes, the trunk column is at most 6 cells wide. Counting the main loop as level 0, the agents it spawned are at level 1, their children at level 2 and theirs at level 3, each one level further along the trunk. An agent deeper than level 3 is drawn at level 3, keeping its own branch (for instance `│ │ └─`) with the levels between omitted; its expanded card names its real parent.

## Configure

In `/config`, or under `pluginConfigs["flightdeck"].options` in `settings.json`:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `architectPattern` | `advisor\|architect` | case-insensitive regex for agent types and server tools that count as the architect |
| `matchDescriptions` | `false` | also match agent descriptions, not just type names |
| `architectLabel` | `ARCHITECT` | the architect's name in the pane |
| `gateLabel` | `GATE` | the permission panel's name |
| `panels` | `main,architect,gate,agents,loops,receipt,log` | which panels show, in order |
| `layout` | `auto` | `mini`, `compact`, `wide`, or `auto` (mini inline, wide from 110 columns docked) |
| `maxCards` | `3` | cards side by side before swimlanes (1–6); fewer if the pane is too narrow |
| `motion` | `while-active` | `off` keeps connectors still |
| `moments` | `true` | show the inferred consult moments |
| `palette` | `theme` | `pastel` uses fixed colours tuned for dark terminals |
| `openOnStart` | `true` | ask to open the pane when a session starts |
| `statusLine` | `true` | context, running agents, consults and denials in the status line |
| `mascot` | `on` | `off` leaves Clawd out of the foot of the pane |
| `cost` | `off` | `on` shows dollar amounts: the session's cost in the main panel and the inline summary, the turn's in the receipt |

## Troubleshooting

**The pane doesn't appear.**
- Check `claude --version` is 2.1.287 or later, then run `/reload-plugins` and `/flightdeck`.
- Below 144 columns, Claude Code won't seat a pane nobody asked for; `/flightdeck` opens it at any width.
- Look in the transcript for a dim line starting `flightdeck:`. It names the hook that failed or the reason the pane was refused. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/scasella/claude-flightdeck/issues) with it.

**Colours look wrong.** Set `palette` to `pastel` in `/config`.

**It's too much motion.** Set `motion` to `off`; Clawd then stands still too, and `mascot: off` removes him.

**Counters look stale after an update.** Run `/flightdeck reset`.

## How it works

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| [`hooks/register.tsx`](hooks/register.tsx) | the event hooks, state access, and one function per panel |
| [`hooks/core.ts`](hooks/core.ts) | every reducer, formatter and layout rule as pure functions, so behaviour is testable directly |
| [`hooks/rail.tsx`](hooks/rail.tsx), [`hooks/spine.tsx`](hooks/spine.tsx), [`hooks/elapsed.tsx`](hooks/elapsed.tsx), [`hooks/clawd.tsx`](hooks/clawd.tsx) | surface modules: animated connectors, the lanes' trunk, live clocks and Clawd, each redrawing only itself on the surface's own frame clock |
| [`types/index.d.ts`](types/index.d.ts) | the state contract |
| [`tests/`](tests) | 45 tests: pure behaviour, plus drawings mounted on every surface at 40–120 columns |

State lives in `$.state` atoms. Every read is merged over defaults, so a missing or older field never breaks the pane; an update that changes the state's shape may still reset its counters once.
